      My name is Ryan Lynch, I am a junior at South Putnam Indiana and I am graduating in 2022. <br>

    I consider myself an introvert but I do love going outside from time to time. <br>
    My favorite type of music at the moment is jazz but I do enjoy all types of music all around. <br>
    Some of my favorite foods are chicken parmesean, pizza, and Meatloaf. My role models are Kobe Bryant, Keanu Reeves, and Afrosenju. <br>
